Automatic Modulation Classification in Python

This project is being updated and better deployed, pull the branch called 'ronny' if you want the most updated code.

Corrections so far:
* main.py runs ok with no errors
* all the required directories will be created as the code runs
* the features are being correctly calculated
* the graphics generated are good, but keep in mind that you will need to install LaTeX
* calculate_features.py, graphics.py and globals.py are now well documented

The following libraries must be installed:

The Tex is used to plot graphics using the fancy mathematical expressions of the calculated features.

Any suggestions to upgrade the code will be considered!
